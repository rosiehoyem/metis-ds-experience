  <h2 class="blog-post-title">Onsite in Chicago, Weeks 4-6</h2>
  <p class="blog-post-meta">February 6th through February 24th, 2017</p>

  <p>Weeks four through six took us through all of the classification models and a whole grab bag of topics related to working in the cloud and web development.</p>

  <p>The big event of week 6 at Metis was the completion of our 3rd project, McNulty. This project was to be focused on the different classification models weâ€™re covered in the past weeks. I again learned the lesson the hard way that real work problems that involve gathering real world messy data are not appropriate for 2 week learning projects.</p>

  <p>My topic, what factors contribute to high schools successfully preparing kids for college, seemed like a straightforward enough project. Alas, it was not. Although the data I collected did not come together how I had hoped, I did manage to get some practice working with a variety of classification models.</p>
